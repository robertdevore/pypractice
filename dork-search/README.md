This is a work in progress and is not ready for production use yet.

### :computer: How to use

`$ python3 DorkSearch.py`

### :pray: Thanks

The dorks included in the `dorks` folder were copied from the [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) website.

### TODO

*   Finish creating the remaining dorks .txt files
*   Add option to choose which search site to use (google, bing, etc)
*   Add parseargs to allow for url, engine, a11y, etc
