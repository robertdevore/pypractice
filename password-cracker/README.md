This was forked from [this repo](https://github.com/mayurkadampro/Python-Hash-Cracker). Long live open source :100:

Example lists are from [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).

**TODO:**

[]   Create a way to loop through a list of usernames and hashed passwords to check multiple accounts at once (possibly a csv file?)
